## Programme notes
The Feather Quartet is a digital score for an improvising quartet. It is inspired by an extract from a Tove Jansson short story The Scolder from her book The Summer Book. In this extract an elderly grandmother is lying down on a quiet beach looking at a tiny piece of down caught in barbs of a plant leaf. She describes in great detail this feather and how it moves with the slight breeze. Her description evokes a sense of beauty in this minute event and draws attention to the profundity of concentrating on such small details. This profound seeking is at the heart of this piece; the musicians are instructed to seek such detail in the score, and the audience are invited into a careful listening experience that acts as a metaphor for the feather caught momentarily in the plant leaf on a deserted beach.

## Performers instructions
The piece is 6 minutes long. When the lead performer – or off stage operator – presses start, the performance-score screen will enlarge to full-screen and start the score. After 6 minutes the screen will fade to black, and reduce to original size. At this cue the musicians draw their improvisation to a close.

## About
The Feather Quartet consists of a software environment that places a collage of extracts of found materials onto four quadrants dividing the computer screen. The found materials consist of two pages of music notation extracted from a Delius score, and an extract from Tove Jansson’s book The Summer Book as both the original Swedish text and the English translation. The end result is a collage of colour and image that refers to the original source materials whilst also acting as a living score, generated live with the software. As such, each performance of this piece will bring forth different score images, yet remain connected to the original material.
The computational process changes the images in each quadrant every 10-20 seconds by cross-filtering them with each other and applying random colouration. The purpose of this process is to create an abstract visual narrative that is anchored by the original source materials. The musicians can interpret these images freely, but the composer requests that they do so by ‘entering into the spirit of the original texts’. The imperative for the musicians is to play something they value or that contributes to their on-going flow. In a poetic sense the digital score is asking the musicians to immerse themselves into the pages of the poem and to create a unified musical response through their collective interpretation.
The digital score is designed to co-operate with the musicians through time and within the musicking realm of performance. Whilst it is not listening, or analysing the humans performance it is creating its own response to the meta-narrative evoked within the source materials. The role of the performers is not to respond to the visual information as didactic notation, but to see it as evoking opportunities for response and stimulation for creativity amongst the ensembles on-going interpretation. As such, the musicians must work together through time as a unit creating an aural dimension that co-operates with the visual dimension evoked by the collage of images.
It is of great importance that each musician reads the following extract before rehearsing or performing this piece. Their interpretation of the score (visual and collective music-making) must be guided by the individual meaning this text evokes.

## Technical setup
The software score is run on a single computer. It is recommended that a large LED screen be used so that each performer can see the score clearly. If the performers do not wish to use screen mirroring, then drag the score window (small black window titled ‘feather’) onto the second screen.
The performers can setup in whichever configuration is suitable. In addition to the performers LED screen, it is possible to project the score on a large screen behind the performers.
